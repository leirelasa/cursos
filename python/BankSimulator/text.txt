The program should:

    Use a variable to store the current account balance.

    Define three functions:

        deposit(amount) → adds to balance

        withdraw(amount) → subtracts from balance (if enough funds)

        check_balance() → prints current balance

    Show a menu in a loop with options: Deposit, Withdraw, Check Balance, Quit.

    Ask for user input, call the appropriate function, and update/display results.

Bonus (optional):

    Reject negative inputs.

    Format balance as currency.

    Track a simple transaction history.

This project is a perfect introduction to function-based design, input validation, and working with program loops.
