Using Fragments
Your task is to edit the existing Summary component such that it outputs the following content:

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>{text}</p>
Inside the Summary component, this content must not be wrapped by any other HTML element!

For example, this code would be wrong:

<div>
  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>{text}</p>
</div>
